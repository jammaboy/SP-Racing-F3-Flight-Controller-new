# SP-Racing-F3-Flight-Controller
The SP Racing F3 Flight Controller Deluxe was designed to give awesome flight performance based on tried and tested sensors whilst also providing unparalleled I/O capabilities in a small and extremely lightweight form-factor using a next-generation CPU.

There are lots of cool features with this flight controller starting with a next-generation STM32 F3 processor with hardware floating point unit for efficient flight calculations and faster ARM-Cortex M4 core. It also comes with a high capacity black box flight log recorder that will help you optimize your tuning without the guesswork.  Some more great features are the additional built-in sensors for altitude and direction with the barometer mounted on the bottom of the board for easy wind isolation. A dedicated output for programmable LEDs – great for orientation, racing and night flying. The no-compromise I/O supports all the features at the same time.

F3 runs the open-source Cleanflight flight control (FC) software which has an ever-growing community of friendly developers and users. Being open-source it allows you to contribute to the system. Cleanflight comes with a detailed manual that is reviewed and maintained by the Cleanflight developers and community. No more second-hand information.

The F3 Deluxe gives you all the features you need for the heart of your aircraft, whether you’re into FPV racing, acrobatic flying or aerial photography it’s perfect.
